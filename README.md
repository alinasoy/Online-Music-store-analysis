## Conclusion
 The store can consider shutting the non-performing regions as it has a very low customer base. Instead of spreading itself thin, it can concentrate on pushing sales in USA and Canada which already has a good report with the customers as it gets lot of repeated sales from a single customer.<br>
· The store should also look at developing Brazil Market as it has got customers who are ready to spend in the store as well as give repeat business.<br>
· Pulling out from non-performing markets may give the store resource to do more advertisement in the popular region. This will in long run, build customer base and thereby push up profits.<br>
· Making a focused effort on building a base will be more beneficial to the store rather than just expanding it presence.
